## 🌐 Translation Helper
- `tanmuhittin/laravel-google-translate` is used to work with Google/Yandex Translate APIs.
- The translate() helper (available globally) uses the `stichoza/google-translate-php` package to translate text between languages without using APIs (for free). It expects ISO 639-1 language codes (e.g., en, fr, ja).
